                <p> With the exponential growth in smart phone ownership, more people are becoming engrossed with their phones. This instaiable need to use devices has had many consequences in people’s driving habits, especially among those who use them the most, young people. This has made it so <strong>you are now more likely to be killed by a distracted driver than a drunk one.</strong>
                    <br>
                    <br> While car manufacturers today are integrating the phone into the cars themselves to mitigate distractions, these newer vehicles are not accessible to young drivers. Young people generally do not have much disposable income, and cannot afford a newer car with this technology.
                    <br>
                    <br> Following a detailed research and testing process spanning my final two semesters at Sheridan College, a product solution was created to mitigate distracted driving. It accomplishes this by simplifying phone content, changing the method of interaction with said content, and mounting the information in front of the driver with a Heads Up Display product.

                <h1 class="projTitle ">Why?</h1>
                <p>Nearly <strong>80% of all accidents today are from distracted driving,</strong> with a quarter being from phone distractions. This means you are now<strong> more likely to be killed by a texter than a drunk driver.</strong> <br><br>

                    While newer cars have more and more technology to help you stay focused, from my research into young or new drivers, the majority do not have access to a new car. This means the users who need this technology the most, young people who have grown up surrounded by technology, do not have it.

                <p>glance is a heads up display, designed to better display your phone content. Following extensive testing and refinement, the most common uses of users phones while driving had been picked out and refined. glance now displays music, gps, and text information for the user.<br><br>

                    Moving the driver’s view to the windshield eliminates any time needed to look away from the road to their phone, and allows for users to still use their peripheral vision.

                <p>Utilizing the majority of smartphones pre-embedded technology, glance takes the information that smartphones already supply to users, and simplifies the content. This simplification prevents additional distractions and only requires engagement from the user when specified.<br><br>

                    Using the smartphone as the middle-man, interacting with the content, moves from a physical tactile interaction (requiring hand, eyes, and in some circumstances ears) to a purely auditory (with minimal visual elements) experience.

                </h3>
                <p>We’ve all heard the news cycle “police are cracking down on distracted driving”, it seems every other week there is a new police sting operation. Yet somehow, <strong>accidents caused by distraction still are on the rise.</strong> For my capstone project of IXD, I decided to focus on this problem:</p>
                                <h2 >How might I combat distracted driving?</h2>
                <p>Purposely starting with a broad challenge statement acted as a guide for the initial round of defining the problem space. This began with secondary research to get a solid grasp of my challenge area, which informed how I should branch out to primary research to get a deeper understanding.</p>

                <p>To start this process I completed a secondary research round on the facts of the issue. This included finding who is affected by this issue, what is the cause of the issue, and what solutions have been tested/implemented?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>You are now twice as likely to be killed by a distracted driver then a drunk one</strong></li>
                    <li>Phones in particular require a larger piece of your brain and concentration to engage with them than other distractions</li>
                    <li><strong>The most common people to be distracted are new/young drivers</strong></li>
                    <li>These are also the most likely to be killed in an accident</li>
                    <li>Car companies are now actively working towards mitigating distracted driving, as are multiple app’s and phone manufacturers</li>

I conducted 8 in depth interveiws and accumalated 62 unique survey responses. From these I pulled out multiple insights including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>From ex-police officer, distracted driving was not a focus in curriculum</li>
                    <li>People do not fear getting caught/getting in an accident while distracted</li>
                    <li>The most common distraction is passengers, but the most distracting are peoples phones</li>
                    <li>People get more distracted the more confident they get</li>
                    <li>Phone users feel the need to keep checking it, and would not be willing to have it constrained whole driving</li>

                <p>At this time some clear themes had begun emerging and I decided that my initial very broad challenge statement could be refined. Based on my research findings of teenagers being most affected and phones identified as the biggest distraction, my new challenge became <strong></strong>

                <p>Using the new challenge statement, I dove deep into the persona and the impact phones have on people's ability to drive. Having this more in depth understanding on the refined issue will guide the design process with a better understanding of the users and their pain-points. </p>
                
                    <h3 class="sectionTitle2">Persona and Interviews
                </h3>
                    <p>A persona kicked things off, focusing on the young drivers most affected by this and most likely to get in accidents. This persona guided my next round of 5 interviews and an additional 18 survey responses.<br><br>
                    
                    I ended up with quite a few more key insights including:</p>
                    <ul>
                <li>The majority of drivers don’t have access to any new car technology, as they typically can’t afford it</li>
                        <li>Over 50% of users interviews and surveyed admitted to using their phone while driving</li>
                        <li>Interviewed users had little interest in phone limiting technology</li>
                        <li>Interviewed members felt the need still to check even if there is no messages (ghost notifications was a common issue)</li>
                        <li>Users typically only used a few key functions on there phone while driving when they would (GPS, Music, and Messaging)</li>
                </ul>
<p> After having a strong grasp on the user I would be solving this problem for, I mapped their current journey and their pain-points that my solution could solve. This would serve as the guide for the next phase of ideation.</p>

                </h3>
                <p>Given the set timelines of the project, I moved directly into ideating from the research. This stage would allow me to flesh out multiple ideas quickly for feedback. In total, around 50 unique ideas were generated, which were then refined down to four based on feasibility, novelty, relevance, and novelty.<br><br>
                   
                    For the 4 concepts I narrowed down too, I wireframed rough concepts and then brought them to potential users of the solution (who fit my persona).<br><br>

This grounds my thinking and immediately arises any potential shortcomings of one idea versus another. I generated some new insights from this as well including:
</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The need to find positives in people's driving, not negatives</li>
                    <li>Modularity is important to users</li>
                    <li>Touchscreens have no feedback tactile feedback, require full focus</li>
                    <li>The final solution should not be a distraction in itself, or at the very least limit the interaction to an easier method then current</li>
                    <li>Any phone content shown, should be summarized and simplified</li>
                    <li>Users need alternative methods for interacting with phone</li>
                </ul>
                <p>At this point it was clear the heads up display solution resonated best with the audience, and fit the defined pain-points of the users best.</p>

                        Some of those were: the HUD’s that use your phone to sit inside it are frustrating as the app support is mediocre, digital screens make the product very expensive, and in some cases become an expensive additional distraction.</p>

                    <li>Colours need to contrast the environment</li>
                    <li>Fonts need to be legible while driving</li>

                    <li>Content stays in place otherwise</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To adhere to these, the functionality was immediately descoped to the 3 key identified phone uses while driving. These from my research were music, GPS, and messaging. For these separate functionalities I iterated through multiple renditions to find the best possible layout.<br><br>
                    As touch screen interaction is extremely attention grabbing, using the phones voice commands for the actual interactions was the best method forward, so I designed with that intention in mind.<br><br> 
                    The final iteration strips back all unnecessary cognitive load and gives users the essentials to be able to make decisions in each core functionality with each screen dedicated to one focus.

                    <p>Following a similar theme as the UI design, simplicity was the focus for the model. The goal was to keep potential product costs cheap (and the product affordable), while still creating a beautifully simple shape. The end item accomplishes both.</p>

                </h3>
                <p > As I did not have access to the likes of eye trackers or virtual environment testing, I had to design an impromptu usability test to determine the products efficacy.
                    <br>
                    <br>To complete this test, I had 2 different drivers from my target users, drive the same vehicle, in the same circumstances around my college campus, and then asked them to perform a series of tasks involving their phone. To measure success I timed them, noted any issues they encounter, any unique behaviours, and followed up with questions on their experience. <br><br>

                    To test the product, I created a functioning prototype using 3D printing and utilized a phone screen to reflect inside of it. I modeled the product to contain a phone which played an animated version of my designed UI. This animated clip of my video was then played remotely when users interacted with the device completing the same tasks via voice.<br><br>

                </h3>
                <p class="headingTxt">I found from the tests conducted that the product worked well! Users accomplished tasks in a similar time frame to using their phone, but spent  significantly less time with their eyes off the road. Even more interesting, the users remarked afterwards that they still had their peripheral vision available to them and were more comfortable completing the tasks<br><br>

                To bring this project further, I would further develop the prototype product, making refinements to the 3D design, display, and UI, then conduct further testing with a far larger user base to understand where further improvements can be made.
