                <p>This project encompassed the research, ideation, design, and development of a product to mitigate distracted driving.
                    <br>
                    <br> With the exponential growth in smart phone ownership, more and more people are becoming engrossed with their phones. This need to use their devices has had many consequences in people’s driving habits. This is especially prevalent among those who use them the most, young people.
                    <br>
                    <br> While car manufacturers today are integrating the phone into the cars themselves to mitigate distractions, these cars are not accessible to young drivers. Young people generally do not have much disposable income, and cannot afford a newer car with this technology.
                    <br>
                    <br> Following a detailed research and testing process spanning two semesters, a product solution was created to mitigate distracted driving. It accomplishes this by simplifying phone content, changing the method of interaction with said content, and mounting the information in front of the driver with a Heads Up Display product. </p>

                <h1 class="title ">Problem</h1>
                <p>The increase in cell phone use has had a negative effect on driving habits of everyone. It is most prevalent with younger people where they use their phones the most.
                    <br>
                    <br> While new cars being released today are fully integrating phones into them, the people who need these most, young drivers, don’t have access to it. They cannot afford a new car.
                    <br>
                    <br> Young drivers need a better way to integrate their phone into their driving experience. </p>

                <h1 class="title ">Solution</h1>
                <p>Based on my research of this user base, I arrived at my solution of a product that can help mitigate distractions while driving. This product consists of a Heads Up Display that connects via bluetooth to people's phones.
                    <br>
                    <br> Aimed at young adults aged 16-24, the product simplifies the phone content they typically interact with and keeps their eyes on the road. </p>

                <p>Initially, I had an interest in a variety of fields with potential issues. However from the topics that interested me most, distracted driving felt as though they had the greatest impact.
                    <br>
                    <br> With current accidents statistics, 80% were caused by distractions while driving. This meant you were now more likely to be killed by a distracted driver then an impaired one. </p>

                <p>I immediately conducted personal research to understand the current situation. While constantly in the news, with big police leaders speaking out and promising changes to stop this issue, almost nobody I spoke to feared getting caught being distracted on their phone. Much like many other issues, people held an optimism bias which carried over even if they were caught.
                    <br>
                    <br> The few who did not were new drivers, and did not have the confidence to use their phone while driving.
                    <br>
                    <br> I continued researching with a survey in which I received over 70 responses. I gathered that the most common distracted or users is actually the driver, but the distraction with the biggest impact are phones. </p>

                    <br> - People need incentive
                    <br> - Need to find positives in people's driving, not negatives
                    <br> - Modularity is important to users
                    <br> - Touchscreens have no feedback tactile feedback, require full focus
                    <br> - The final solution should not be a distraction in itself
                    <br> - Any phone content shown, should be summarized and simplified
                    <br> - Users need alternative methods for interacting with phone

                    <br> The device decided upon was a Heads Up Display as it could keep users eyes forward, provide an alternative engagement point for their phone, and could simplify this content the user uses most.</p>

                    <br> The secondary journey map details the journey with the product instead. Utilizing technology through the device is far less distracting and requires less concentration. I found that the aiding of tasks users typically use their phone with improved the entire driving experience. </p>

                <p>Through the business model, I found the keys to this product's success in market. Users need to be given the value of staying connected, while simultaneously avoiding getting caught.

                <p>The competitor analysis of a few key products in this field validated my assumptions into current issues, and user needs. The product range in the HUD market are all very expensive. The exception are those that are simply phone stands, which users complain about lack of access, as well as screen legibility.
                    <br>
                    <br> The other key component derived from this research is the UI design variety. Some are extremely poorly laid out, while more expensive models have a simpler, more modern take on the interface. </p>

        </div>
                <p>The UI Design for the Heads Up Display varied greatly in the process. From my user testing and feedback sections, a few very strong trends drove this projects forward. They were:
                    <br>
                    <br> - Information must be simple
                    <br> - Cut out anything unnecessary
                    <br> - Colours need to contrast the environment
                    <br> - Fonts need to be legible while driving
                    <br> - Animations need to be non-flashy, simple
                    <br> - Prioritize information by users choice
                    <br> - Content stays in place otherwise
                    <br>
                    <br>The final design simplifies content on the screen taken from the phone, and changes interactions from touch based, to voice based. The HUD only displays the three pieces of content found to be used by users most while driving. These are texting, GPS, and music. </p>

                <h1 class="title ">Model Design</h1>
                <p>The 3D model itself also took on many forms. Originally going to be more organic to integrate better into past car interiors, costs was a potential issue for mass production. Because of this a simpler form was created, one that matched the simple interface.
                    <br>
                    <br> From user testing iterations, I also found that the solid component of the HUD (the base) blocks the view when too thick. As I was already constructing the item to sit flush with the dash, more material had to be constrained to a thinner area. </p>

                <h1 class="title ">Branding</h1>
                <p>The product branding was an integral part of the process, as they product needed to stand out from the typical HUD space. glance was decided upon for its relation to the interaction (glancing at the device), and its inclusion of glass.
                    <br>
                    <br> For visual elements, a simplistic word based logo was constructed using drawn type. Recongizability and ease of re-creation were imperative to the project to make sure the product is identified correctly. A darker colour palette as also decided upon to indicate refinement of the product. </p>

                <p>The final prototype consisted of a 3D model which encased a phone to demonstrate the HUD’s functionality. The final product would not use a phone. For demonstration purposes, the phone looped an animated video of the interface.
                    <br>
                    <br> A final simplified website was constructed in tandem with the prototype to introduce potential customers to the product. The website relays small pieces of information about glance and its functionality. </p>

                <p>Due to time constraints, the final prototype was never tested within a car setting aside from a few personal tests. This prevents me from calling the project a success, as further testing is required to prove the products worth.
                    <br>
                    <br> Another key issue was the animation itself of the interface. While the interface was iterated constantly, the animations were developed initially and only refined slightly. Moving forward I would get further feedback on the HUD’s transitions and interactions.
                    <br>
                    <br> Finally, I realize a mistake I had made at the beginning of this process. When ideating about potential solutions (and converging on the options) I failed to take into account the buy in for a final product as I created. Users with such little income would much prefer something cheaper, or even free. An application for their phone may have been a better choice, and is something I may consider developing in the future. </p>
