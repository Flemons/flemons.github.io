                <p>Encompassing the first month of my time at integrate.ai, the first pass of the product saw me answer <strong> what could an artificial intelligence product look like?</strong><br><br>
                    With no other product team members, and no pre-existing product I worked on all aspects of definition, design, and development from scratch.<br><br>

                    The project's objective was obtaining a “lighthouse” partner through a pitch of a functioning product that better enables our clients to integrate our AI. <br><br>

                    The final presentation succeeded in achieving buy-in from this key partner, resulting in a long-term contract with us and a solidified partnership that still holds strong today.

                    <li class="headingTxt body-01">
                        <strong>Difficulty in tracking</strong> - The users only had their own internal tracking tools, making it difficult to prove our impact on their outcomes. </li>
                    <li class="headingTxt body-01">
                        <strong>Lack of control</strong> - A model requires 2-3 revisions before implementation due to changing client needs. This was a massive engineering effort and impacted the strength of the models.</li>

                    It would be a bigger industry “first”, potentially leading to more outside interests from users and had the potential to alleviate the other issues depending on implementation.

                <p>The <strong>majority of my inspiration came from a wide range of other industries</strong>. I  utilized my domain experts for inspiration, then constructed a broader product inspiration board.<br><br>

                <p>WIth the inspiration board as a starting point, <strong>the focus was on novel concepts in sketching</strong>, keeping them simple to quickly finish as many concepts as possible.<br><br>

                    I scheduled daily meetings with the product owner formatted as pitches the ideas to get pointed feedback on what worked, and what didn’t for further refinement.<br><br>
After pitching a select few concepts to the domain experts, the <strong>decided approach was to have a visual illustrating predicted outcomes of users choices, in the spectrum of other predicted possibilities.</strong> <br><br>

                    From my research, the users identified are constantly comparing, looking for better ways to improve their work which best fit with this idea.

                        The <em>Constraints</em> input in the UI was a challenge as the user is <strong>making decisions that could impact millions of dollars in revenue</strong>. The inputs played a part in this understanding, with big but <em>simple</em> choices to make at each input.<br><br>

                        The <em>Expected Lift</em> graph utilized bright vibrant colouring, with animated line movements, drawing the eye to the changes in predicted outcome, clearly demonstrating the comparison of the model to model changes, and summarized with a single metric outcome.

                <p class="headingTxt body-01">Given the speed of the project and my like of tenure at the company, I took the objectives given to me at face value and questioned very little, overestimating my capabilities. This led to a larger workload, and rushed portions of the project.<br><br>

With only a few weeks to deliver, it would have been beneficial to have a more in depth initial discussion on the results the team hoped for outcomes of the project, and where my skill set could be applied to best achieve it.<br><br>
                    
                    

The other main takeaway from this project was the importance of time boxing. With the short time span, my calendar should have been immediately scoped to what needed to be done, in order to keep a gauge on my progress, and identify sticking points.
