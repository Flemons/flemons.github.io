                <p>This project follows the design and development of a web based interactive data visualization for the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/innovation-hub.html" style="color:#5a85a0" target="_blank">Canadian Innovation Hub</a>, completing with a final presentation in Ottawa of the website.<br><br>

Building off of a mega map installation from a previous semester, this project focuses on housing prices in Canada. Canadians do not save to prepare for this massive purchase in their lives leaving a large amount of resources provided by the government unused.<br><br>

Using similar data to the mega map installation, a web based interactive data-visualization was created. <br><br>

The website aims to provide context and relatability to the housing markets jump. It does this by comparing the price of homes to other typical items that Canadian families would purchase and adding visuals from each era to tie users to the time periods.

                <h1 class="title ">Problem</h1>
                <p>Due to an extreme rise in property value across Canada, home ownership is becoming more and more difficult for lower-income families. Yet a massive percentage of Canadians do not try to plan for these larger purchases. <br><br>

This also causes a large amount of government resources untouched by citizens, as well as a wealth of knowledge on purchasing homes. Canadians have to be shown how big of a problem this is for them. Providing them with a  focus on what can be done and is offered to them will help Canadians better prepare for their first home purchase.

                <p>Working with the Canadian Government's Innovation Hub, and utilizing animating concepts for web based applications, this project aimed satisfy the challenge by visualizing the issue of rising housing costs from the perspective of the common middle-class family. <br><br>

The final website demonstrates this issue with a timeline beginning in 1984 to 2016. This website placed important dates along the horizontally scrolling timeline, do evoke a nostalgic viewpoint, and bring more context to how quickly the market changed.

The other key point brought forward from the canvas was the level of impact the housing situation has on people. Not only in a sense of individuals, but scale among thousands with the changes in housing density.

Due to job changes and the increase of telecommuting, more and more people are comfortable with integrating into alternative communities, such as repurposed buildings. <br><br>
This is also due to the fact that they look for any method to save money, and in a general sense, cannot afford a safer community for their children.

                        <p>Wage has gone up minimally versus housing costs in Canada. While wage has increased a minor 5-10%, housing has increased 650% since 1984.

                        <h1 class="title ">Cause</h1>
                        <p>1 in 8 homes are being purchased by foreign investors leaving little to no homes for locals. This number at the time of the project was unregulated, meaning no additional taxes that have since been put in place. The immense demand in Toronto is also not being met anywhere near with new construction projects.

                        <h1 class="title ">Solution</h1>
                        <p>Our proposed solution in the short term was to eliminate the vacancy rebates for the GTA. Long term was to evaluate unused buildings and consider rezoning them to better fit the current needs of people in the area.<br><br>

Following the presentation of the mega-map installation, it was suggested to narrow scope of the audience, as the lower and middle class persons made up a vast majority of the population. The project here shifted focus to the lower-middle class families, based in major metropolitan areas which are most affected by the housing market.

                        <p>Given the data sets from the previous stage, another key problem from the view of the new user group was knowledge. So few people understood what was available to them to utilize by the government.<br><br>

The ideation brought to light the idea of giving meaning to these changes to costs in relation to homes. Providing visuals that bring this context to the decades of increase could go a long way in developing significance to this data.<br><br>

Finally, the project also aims toward families, which means the visuals and information has to be interesting to both the adults and young kids in the house hold.

                        <p>Designing off of these ideated points was difficult, as to show the timeline like a cityscape a horizontally scrolling site would be a method I had never attempted before. I felt given my multiple designs, the horizontal timeline was most straightforward for the visual elements to progress in a linear fashion.<br><br>

The imagery for the project would all be bright and vibrant to display in contrast of the looming overarching chart of housing costs.To keep load times down and allow for manipulations, the elements would be svg based. Along with the simplified visuals, the copy and numbers would be kept simplified as well. This keeps the platform accessible to both adults and youths. <br><br>

The key events themselves that are coupled with the time periods were chosen due to their significance and likelihood to be remembered.

                        <p>This project at the time was one of the biggest undertakings I had personally picked up. The project was intended to be a group project but I was driven to a subject area without any other interest.<br><br>
                            This lead to a few mistakes. Given the time frame available, the project was not prioritized correctly. Dedicating more time to  completing the interactive component instead of visuals would have been a better plan. As it stands the visuals were not completed, and the code still runs into issues when progressing.<br><br>

The concept I feel could have been better executed with a far more simplified experience. The website itself is almost completely inline SVG based, making it very difficult to work with. Having more elements based in HTML would have allowed for easier manipulation, as well as
