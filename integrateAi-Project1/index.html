                <p>This project consisted of a 4 week sprint to start my time at integrate.ai. At that time there were no other members of the product team, as well as no existing product. This meant I worked on all aspects of research, design, and front-end development for this first iteration. <br><br>

                    In contrast to later sprints, the end goal of this was purely to generate interest and buy-in from one of our key clients. The end of this project succeeded in this regard and resulted in the partner signing an extended contract with us.

                <p class="headingTxt">integrate.ai has multiple clients across a wide spectrum of industries. However, over 50% of them were operating on ‘trial’ short term contracts, and had allocated minimal effort to aid the partnership. This is due to the fact that it was difficult to attribute and trust our impact on their business. <br><br>

                    This is compounded by a lack of distinct product that enabled us to be seen as the SAAS company we positioned ourselves as.

                </h3>
                <p>WIth no background in anything resembling machine learning or artificial intelligence, I had my work cut out for me just to understand the domain. While retaining as much as I could about what the AI is, and how it functions today, I also set out to understand who these buyers were, what problems were they having, and where was there opportunity for a fully fledged product to aid them.

                <h3 class="sectionTitle2">Approach
                </h3>
                <p>The approach saw me manage 2, one on one interviews with advocates from this client. While not ideal, the short timeline (especially coordinating with enterprise clients) only permitted this many, so I maximized my understanding with a broad spectrum of questions focused around the users and their processes. <br><br>

                    To act as a proxy and additional source of information on both the AI and our users, I built an active feedback loop with 4 team members who were internal domain experts. These individuals were picked based on their experience with the company, as well as their distinct roles to get as much breadth of knowledge as possible. This included daily conversations and checkpoints that I scheduled to get them actively involved and comfortable with the design process. This was along with teaching sessions, where I would learn and then relay the same information back to the experts to affirm my understanding. <br><br>

                    My final, and one of the most beneficial tactics I took was a support audit. I had leads from the conversations I had previously conducted, so I utilized the Customer Love team who acted as a support group for our clients. Through both conversations with these team members, as well as reviewing typical client conversations and hacks they or the clients had created, a few common problems honed into view.

                </h3>
                <p>Having gathered an understanding of our AI, as well as the potential users and their problems, I highlighted 3 key challenges for our users that us as a company could apply ourselves to. These were:<br></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>A lack of transparency</strong> - As our models for our artificial intelligence were created in-house, there was little to no understanding on their side as to how the AI works. This meant people were apprehensive about taking direction from it and hesitant to dedicate a lot of time to it. The process to alleviate this was completed through email only, where a back and forth chain would occur with questions and concerns from users to the customer love team. These email chains ended up upwards of 100+ replies long.</li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Difficulty in tracking</strong> - At the time, the best method of tracking the AI models was with users on their own internal tracking tools, typically tableau. The difficulty came from proving our impact, as the comparison had to be done using historic data, often by hand, by our Customer Love team. This, once again was completed using email and made it extremely difficult to pinpoint our exact influence on their outcomes.</li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Lack of control</strong> - While business constraints were definitely top of mind for our Machine Learning Scientists, this did not mean it was an easy process. In fact, a typical model before being pushed into production required 2-3 revisions. This was typically due to changing client KPI’s or changes to audience requirements. This was a massive effort in coordination and reworking, but also ultimately impacted the strength of the models, as less testing time was available. And just like before, this was done completely over email with the added phone call if the enterprise user had the time.</li>
                </ul>

                </h3>
                <p>Given the 3 distinct problem areas I had identified, I immediately coordinated a short pitch presentation containing the facts I had found above. This was shown to a few members of the leadership team was well as my acting product owner, the Principal Product Manager.<br><br>

                    With the main outcome of succeeding in an upsell, still top of mind, we came to the conclusion that while all 3 are preferable to tackle, the Lack of control was the problem with the biggest opportunity for us. <br><br>

                    This problem was selected because of the possibilities it presented giving users more control. It would be a bigger industry “first”, and could potentially lead to far more excitement from users interested in engaging with the product.

                </h3>
                <p>As the problem space was quite new, the majority of my inspiration came from other industries. I initially utilized my domain experts and product owner for inspiration, asking who they saw as competitors, and what other products did they feel would be a strong example to follow. <br><br>

                    WIth their thoughts captured, I moved to constructing a product inspiration board combining their suggested competitors, along with a large swath of additional industries and other visuals I had sourced.

                <h3 class="sectionTitle2">Wireframing
                </h3>
                <p>WIth the inspiration board as a starting point, I purposely went novel with the concepts I was sketching. The sketches were purposely simplified, as opposed to higher detail to complete as many of varying concepts as possible in the short timeline I had.<br><br>

                    Completed in Figma, I scheduled regular daily conversations with the product owner who was acting as the product owner in this project. These sessions were formatted as me giving pitches and explanations of each individual idea to get pointed advice on what worked, and what didn’t for further refinement.

                <p>Similar to before, I pitched a few key concepts for this product to the domain experts as well as the product owner. I was pointed in what I was looking for; a decision on what concept they believed best accomplished our goal of more buy-in.<br><br>

                    With the outcome top of mind, it became clear that one of the more unique and innovative concepts would have the most impact. This led to the decided approach which was to have a visual illustrating the predicted outcome of the choices the user had made, in the full spectrum of predicted possibilities. <br><br>

                    This would have an interactive panel allowing users to input the most important parameters and data to them, then compare it in the full spectrum of possibilities. This idea enabled me to focus my iterations as I moved to the digital mock-up phase.

                <p>After deciding on a format of the product for the next round of ideation, I iterated different ways to lay out the controls and the data visualization, as well as integrating any necessary information to do with each model.<br><br>

                    On top of continuing my regular check-ins with the product owner, I also pulled more information from my domain expert group. I wanted to make sure that any information that was required for comparing model to model could be easily accessible and act as a source of grounding in the UI.

                <p>The AI Controller at this point had a full spectrum of different visuals to work with which I had created in low-fidelity mockups. After a final touch base with the product owner for feedback, 4 concepts which had been shown off were chosen to be refined. <br><br>

                    While still varying in functionality and visual approach, the premise still held true with the initial sketch in the previous stage. <br><br>

                    From the 4 mid-fidelity concepts, I pitched another proposal with the domain experts and product owner where I went over in detail the interactions and expected flow of users utilizing each concept, noting feedback along the way.<br><br>

                    It became evident a preference towards the line graph visual stood out best, and the group felt that graph style best suited the forecasted futures approach we had with the client.

                <p>With the decision made on visual and format, a quick sprint of fine tuning was completed. Given the complexity of the data to be included, it was a great challenge to simplify the interactions while still maintaining some semblance of understandability for the demonstration. <br><br>

                    Constraints in the UI were especially difficult, as the user is essentially making decisions that could impact millions of dollars in revenue. To make it clear the impact your actions have, I completed a lot of iterations on how animations and other visual patterns could be used to exemplify this decision making.<br><br>

                    Similar to the constraints panel, the outcomes panel on the right was a hot topic for debate in the previous pitch. Domain experts had conflicting opinions on which KPIs would best fit there. Ultimately I made the decision and went with their objective function only. I made this decision for two reasons: <br>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        As the objective for the project sought to incite interest, it needed to be immediately recognizable</li>
                    <li>
                        Almost all metrics boil down to one objective. For this particular client, it was a revenue.

My experience was in HTML/CSS and Javascript, but engineering had a preference for React.js due to its ease of reusing components across the product, and more importantly, it’s ease of manipulation when new models were created.<br><br>

                    Collaborating closely with engineering, I researched and identified a key library for the visualization (chart.js) that was react native, and implemented it along with a user input panel that used default react components. This panel when interacted with highlighted the predicted outcome of the model given your chosen business constraints.

                <p>The presentation was set with 6 decision makers from our client, in which 3 were at an executive level. I introduced, pitched and then demoed our products' functionality directly to the client’s. With the background provided, the majority of the buyers were immediately intrigued, with the rest joining after a few short questions.<br><br>

                    The clients were very excited to see more, and had lot’s of immediate feedback on functionality, process, data, and layout. With the time that I had provided I followed-up and probed more on pieces of feedback that were especially valuable to the foundations of the product.<br><br>

                    The product was deemed a success as within a few short weeks they had extended and grown their contract with us, which helped to solidify them as our primary partner moving forward.
