                <p>In the past our AI had been using a Random Forest approach to models, which is primarily created and then remains unchanged until a ML scientist modifies it. The new approach utilizes a Contextual Bandit which learns and adapts on it’s own without redevelopment.<br><br>

                    With the changes both in approach and use case, the people and companies we were designing for had changed. The main outcome of this iteration was to re-identify our users, their processes, and how we can aid them, then redesign the product to better fit this process, and our new approach with the AI. At my departure, a first pass on users, their problems, and processes had been completed, accompanying the redesigned Contextual Bandit focused product.

                <h1 class="projTitle ">Problem</h1>
                <p>Our machine learning team from the beginning had been using a Random Forest approach to models. This forced them to make changes manually and required a lot of engineering effort. It also relied heavily on historic data to create the initial model, which not all new clients had.<br><br>

                    The company decided to move towards Contextual Bandits which learn on their own and require far less engineering effort, on top of needing little to no need of historic data<br><br>

                    The biggest implication for the product as it currently stood, was that a model created in the UI would actually be created, not just selected from a pre-generated list. This had implications for things such as forecasted results, the lifecycle of models, and even any user input necessary for model creation.

                <h1 class="projTitle ">Solution</h1>
                <p>Revising the product lead to large changes and ultimately the removal of the FAM suite format. As Contextual Bandits would required more detail and input from the user, a step by step format was created that guided users through the full end to end of creating their own custom model.<br><br>

                    After putting their model into action they would be prompted with updates on it’s progression to full autonomy from it’s random learning phase in the campaign HUB, the replacement for activate. This screen also provided robust visuals for users to get an understanding of how their model is performing and then enact different approaches to try and solve potential issues differently.

                </h3>
                <p>Given the new approach for the company, some of our initial research and design iterations had become greatly deprecated. As a company which was now 3 years old, there was no clear product market fit, a clear definition of where we fit in the market today. The gaps that existed in understanding the 3rd and primary persona, as well as their common problems had now become imperative to the company's success.

                </h3>
                <p>As an advocate for spending the time to gain this understanding since my start at integrate.ai, I was tasked with leading an in-depth research study partnered with my COO, and a PM. This project would encompass 70+ total interviews conducted through respondent.io in a span of 3 months. The approach I put in place was to strive initially for quantity and breadth, then move to more refined qualitative and directional interviews.

                </h3>
                <p>We utilized the initially completed research as a guide for starting points, but found very quickly that searching for a role title was fruitless. The variance in company to company in actual role function was massive. Thus starting intentionally broad in job titles and functions, helped to understand at a faster pace who best fits using our product, and who else may be involved.

                <h3 class="sectionTitle2">Outcomes
                </h3>
                <p>With the initial focus of product market fit, the end result was not going to be realized until the product itself has been in the hands of the users. The intention was to achieve the “40% rule” after the product had been released, to determine if it was invaluable. This was to be completed at the end of the new rendition.<br><br>

                    As previously mentioned however, a total of 3 user archetypes and a customer journey map was constructed to aid in the construction of this new rendition. These archetypes served as the base understanding of what users expected, what they needed, and what they were most used to.

                    Archetypes instead of personas were decided upon, due to the inherent variations in the people we felt would use our product. The were defined not by job titles or more specific tendencies, but by broader common characteristics.<br><br>

                    These archetypes were then mapped with a process that identified how companies complete the process that our tool integrates in today. This customer journey map saw through the lifecycle of an advertising campaign, highlighting who was involved, the tasks that are being completed, and the challenges facing team members in the work today.

                </h3>
                <p>While the previous iterations had less context and more opportunity for wide breadth of exploration, this iteration focused more on the process versus any one screen. Because of the move away from refining a list, I used design patterns that reflected a step by step process coming to a final conclusion.<br><br>

                    Ecommerce checkout flows and various softwares account creation were big ideas that influenced the exploration. But I also kept novelty alive looking at some video games, and even instruction manuals.

                <h3 class="sectionTitle2">Wireframing and low-Fidelity Mockups
                </h3>
                <p>With the new user archetypes and journey map as a guide, the current “FAM” product suite was going to transition away from picking a pre-generated model from a list of choices, to creating an entirely new one from scratch that would learn on it’s own.<br><br>

                    Contextual Bandits have a few key differences from Random Forest that I explored in low-fidelity mockups. They require a learning period where it will not “exploit” or immediately push certain promos. Cold-start use cases also would no longer yield a forecasted result beforehand, as predicting how the contextual bandit would learn was impossible. <br><br>

                    The exploration also included a major asset of integrate.ai which had not yet been prevalent in the integrate.ai product, the Trusted Signal Exchange. This was pushed as our “difference maker” in the industry and essentially allowed for users to see the benefits that sharing signals from their data could provide.

                </h3>
                <p>The main, major new addition for this iteration was the added control users have for setting up a model. As mentioned before, users now no longer pull from a list of pre-generated concepts, but build a model from scratch instead. <br><br>

                    Using the journey map as the guide it was intended to be, we determined a new user flow that matched both this journey map, and the new necessary steps to build the bandit. The flow was setup as follows:<br><br>

                    <em>Model Setup</em><br>
                    Users have the opportunity to set up the majority of the parameters to suit their needs best in a few short steps. These steps simplify the input of constraints the AI needs to create a model, taking inspiration from profile onboarding tools in other applications. <br><br>

                    With the Machine Learning team as our guide we determined several necessary steps that require user input to create a model. They were:<br>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Name</li>
                    <li>Objective function</li>
                    <li>Offers available</li>
                    <li>Products to be included</li>
                    <li>Traffic allocation</li>
                    <li>Budget</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The added benefit to a few items on this list is that they match what our personas prefer to control today. One of the main tools that the users we interviewed work with and understand is AB testing tools. Users want the control on how much of their site/product visitation traffic is dedicated to the campaign and how much is included in a control group for comparison. The Model Setup makes this simple.<br><br><em>Model Hub</em>
                    Using activate as the base, here users have an overview of the entire spectrum of active, queued, and past models. Each model has its corresponding summary metrics that demonstrate their efficiency and a trend graph highlighting their objective functions trend over time. Both of which were included in this manner to incite that deeper dive of understanding.<br><br>

                    Another major difference for this version was the inclusion of the TSE. The visual below each item demonstrated specific ranked signals in the network that has benefitted each model based on impact. This was very much a business pushed decision to have it in such a prominent place, as the initial concept had it better integrated into the individual model panels.<br><br>

                    The other main update for this iteration was the expanded views of the individual models. Prior to this, more data could only be found when selecting the monitor button to be brought to a separate page. Now, a lot more robust, the model dropdowns included visuals corresponding to individual products monitor, offer performance and effectiveness, and customer cluster analysis. All of which were ways of looking at data that were not currently available to our users, and data sets that had previously been extremely difficult to surface.<br><br>

                    A Model Monitor update was also queued to be the next step, but my time was cut short before we could move to changing it to best suit the new process.</p>

                <p>The initial main goal of identifying product market fit was not complete in my time at integrate.ai. As the company was forced to withstand the test of coronavirus, the extreme dropping of clients and lack of user base resulted in little to no real gauge of if the product would fit the 40% theory. <br><br>

The second component of where the product could fit identifying, defining, and mapping out the process of our specific personas was only partly complete. While a first pass at all of the above had been completed, I never got the opportunity to further refine these user research tools any further then that. This meant that the research that was conducted never was ever, full synthesized.<br><br>

The final goal that was nearly completed, was the integrate.ai product redesign. While two of the three major steps in the process were finished, the final piece of the puzzle, product monitor, never was updated to fully complete the product update. Thus, once again, incomplete.
