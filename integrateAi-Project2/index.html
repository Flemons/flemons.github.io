                <p>The first pass on the integrate.ai product focused on the batch-outbound approach we had taken with our primary client. However in the interest of moving towards a true SAAS model, the company made the decision to pivot towards inbound real-time use cases.<br><br>

                    This iteration would entail a full rethink of the initial integrate.ai product in which I focused on:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A series of user interview and feedback sessions completed internally along with my newly appointed Director of Design</li>
                    <li>A user interview series which I helped coordinate through an outside vendor</li>
                    <li>Ideation, design, and working on implementation with our new front-end engineer</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The outcome of this version was to get our customers onboarded and working with a newly updated application that better served their needs, to help solve the problems we had identified. The end result was a product that had been released to 3 of our major partners and had plans to make it more widely accessible in the near future.</p>

                <p>The intial iteration of the integrate.ai product had been designed and developed with a specific use case in mind. However, their were many difficulties in catering to this mode of operation including lack of clarity and attribution in data, difficulty in implementation, and difficulty in learning as the data cycle could take months to complete.<br><br>

                    The company as a whole decided to move towards real-time inbound customers with a digital component as a focus. This meant that the initial product was no longer best suited for our new clients and their needs given the change in implementation.

                <p>This revision of the integrate.ai product saw the rework of the forecast AI manipulation tool, along with two new products to solve problems raised in the research phase. These products were Activate, for queueing, editing, and ending active models, and monitor, for dissecting the outcomes of both past and present models.<br><br>

                    Combined they became the FAM suite and completed the first end to end lifecycle of a model purely within a user-interface.

                </h3>
                <p>Utilizing the interest levels we had set in the previous iteration, me and my new Director of Design immediately booked 10 separate interview/feedback sessions with a wide variety of members at our initial client. This aimed to paint a clearer persona and better understand the process we fit in with their work.<br><br>

                    While their involvement would seem no longer helpful at first, these team members were actively involved in real-time inbound digital use cases that they could offer their perspective on.<br><br>

                    These sessions were divided between foundational questions, understanding the roles, responsibilities, problems and processes of each interviewee, and feedback sessions. The feedback sessions consisted of product click through demos, where participants would provide feedback on the user flow as they engage with it and describe how they see this fitting or not fitting into their work.<br><br>

                    I synthesized the feedback from these sessions into four general categories:<br>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Difficulty in comparison</strong> - A lot of users had the biggest difficulty comparing similar models to one another, it was not obvious the tradeoffs they were making.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Lack of necessary detail for decision making</strong> - While the first pass had their highest importance metrics, other KPIâ€™s such as conversion rate and result dispersion (among campaigns). To some of these users, this was as important if not more so.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Difficulty in learning curve for getting started</strong> - Although it was generally well received visually, it was evident that the lack of a more typical design pattern, and poor understanding of the product's functionality made it difficult to get into.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Uncertainty around how it would fit in their day to day workflow</strong> - The product in its current state also bore little to no resemblance to their approach today. Working with this tool was too big of a shift from their comfort zone.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    A lot of these issues had basis in the higher level problems we had heard before: <em>trust, transparency, and control.</em> It was clear these would be the focus of the new iteration.<br><br>

                    However, the results of the user interview portions were far less conclusive. The team members we spoke to at our client all seemed to not fit what we had felt was the ideal user, a price adjuster or pricing analyst, and had little to no insights about these roles at their company.

                </h3>
                <p>Post our internal research effort, it became clear that we would need external assistance to further define our understanding of our users, as my and my directorâ€™s time was being pulled into other work and many questions were still left unanswered.<br><br>

                    Initially, leadership were hesitant to offer funding for this outside assistance, but through my avocation and explanation of what benefits it would provide, I secured funding for an initial round of research.<br><br>

                    This was completed with a small independent researcher, who focused on our current client base. My role in this work saw me onboarding the research as well as coordinating with, and listening in on their user interviews. <br><br>

                    After the results of this research round were completed with our current clients, we moved towards a larger research agency to broaden our understanding through external, non-affiliated companies. On top of taking a more active role in research at this stage, where I now actively engaged in interviews, I also aided and led workshops pertaining to the results of this research.<br><br>

                    In conclusion of the research, we had a firm understanding of 2 personas who are involved in the process and the problems they possess, along with the foundations of a third persona to be refined later.

                </h3>
                <p>Accompanying this research, was a current product review with the Machine Learning team to get feedback on how the change in use case would affect the product. I pushed for this walkthrough to not only identify clear problem areas of focus for the incoming ideation, but also to get a better understanding of what this use case actually was.<br><br>

                    This brought up a variety of issues but the two major challenges identified were:<br>


                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Forecasted predictions for each model are now less accurate</strong> - This is due to the ambiguity in visitors to the website, and has to be based off of historic visitation trends
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Far clearer understanding of impact</strong> - As the AI had now â€˜closed the loopâ€™, when a user was influenced to make a purchase at the exact moment of impact by our AI, it could be easily pointed to.
                    </li>

                <p>Using the research completed as the cornerstone, I completed a suggested user flow to guide the rest of the design of the product. This guide, although simple, utilized the current understanding of our clients present day process along with clearly stated problems that had been raised both in this round of research and previously conducted research. <br><br>

                </h3>
                <p>The product at this point, as made clear from the user flow, was going to need big changes. Instead of pulling from more abstract and futuristic looking interfaces, I looked for inspiration back in the wide spectrum of currently existing products.<br><br>

                    This led me to ecommerce sites such as Apple, Google, and IKEA and their approach to refining a list to identify a final product that meets a user's specifications. This loosely matched the current expected user flow of the integrate.ai product and could be a recognizable pattern to help ground users in the interface.

                </h3>
                <p>As the user would be working with a list and making a decision on which predicted model to choose, I found that more than just ecommerce had similar design patterns that could be applied. For this divergent wireframing phase I explored concepts inspired by a wide range of industries such as: ecommerce, package tracking/logistics, music streaming, search engines, even some SQL querying tools.

                <p>With the connections to some of the team members still available, I pitched several of the new concepts to them. The result was a resounding preference towards the ecommerce inspired concept as the comparison from one result to the next was far more clear, and itâ€™s flow was far more familiar than the original.

                <h3 class="topDesc sectionTitle2">Mockups

                </h3>
                <p>Moving from wireframes to mockups, the opportunity had become clear to expand our product from beyond the one screen application we started with. While Forecast still operated as the mainstay of the product, allowing users to pick the campaign that fits their specific needs best, two new components Activate (for campaign management) and Monitor (for campaign tracking) were added.<br><br>

                    Forecast saw a plethora of changes. Comparison of one model to the next one was key, so the inclusion of saving and comparison was another critical addition. This was also aided in far more refined detail, giving users the opportunity to compare more specific metrics from one model versus another. And the other clear method of distinction completely opposite of metrics was the visual bars. These had the benefit of being visually scannable, displaying the expected impact the promotions would have on business results.<br><br>

                    The changes to forecast suited the shift to real-time inbound well as the visuals instead of being based on set discrete values, instead could rely on percentages instead. This meant it would have no issue with scaling as users further edited their search results.<br><br>

                    Joining Forecast in the IAI product suite is Activate. After a user had selected which model they wanted to use, there was no clear next step. Where would a user monitor, modify, or even end currently live models? The solution was the Activate hub, which lists all current, queued, and past models that had been selected by users. Inspiration here came from music player queues such as Spotify where current, previous, and coming up songs were organized accordingly in a scannable list.<br><br>

                    Activate also helped to solve another major problem we found in our research, a difficulty in understanding how to incorporate it into their process today. With the activate step, it fits with our understood flow of â€˜followingâ€™ campaigns as a team as the time period progresses. What Activate does even better is allowing a simple summary view, of all activate, queued, and past campaigns in an easily digestible page. No specific data queries necessary!<br><br>

                    Finally, Monitor had been added to round out the product suite. A major piece of feedback from the initial product was a lack of potential deep dives when looking through the data. The users are most used to tableau dashboards or deep excel spreadsheets.<br><br>

                    To best tackle this issue, I worked with what users again were most familiar with, in this case dashboards. The key here is I did not try and replace them. As they already had immense data manipulation capabilities, this page sought to surface key starting points and essentially sources of inspiration for a round of slicing and dicing data with sql instead.

                    Initially, leadership were hesitant to offer funding for this outside assistance, but through my avocation and explanation of what benefits it would provide, I secured funding for an initial round of research.<br><br>

                    This was completed with a small independent researcher, who focused on our current client base. My role in this work saw me onboarding the research as well as coordinating with, and listening in on their user interviews. <br><br>

                    After the results of this research round were completed with our current clients, we moved towards a larger research agency to broaden our understanding through external, non-affiliated companies. On top of taking a more active role in research at this stage, where I now actively engaged in interviews, I also aided and led workshops pertaining to the results of this research.<br><br>

                    In conclusion of the research, we had a firm understanding of 2 personas who are involved in the process and the problems they possess, along with the foundations of a third persona to be refined later.

                </h3>
                <p>Accompanying this research, was a current product review with the Machine Learning team to get feedback on how the change in use case would affect the product. I pushed for this walkthrough to not only identify clear problem areas of focus for the incoming ideation, but also to get a better understanding of what this use case actually was.<br><br>

                    This brought up a variety of issues but the two major challenges identified were:<br>


                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Forecasted predictions for each model are now less accurate</strong> - This is due to the ambiguity in visitors to the website, and has to be based off of historic visitation trends
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Far clearer understanding of impact</strong> - As the AI had now â€˜closed the loopâ€™, when a user was influenced to make a purchase at the exact moment of impact by our AI, it could be easily pointed to.
                    </li>

                </h3>
                <p>Using the research completed as the cornerstone, I completed a suggested user flow to guide the rest of the design of the product. This guide, although simple, utilized the current understanding of our clients present day process along with clearly stated problems that had been raised both in this round of research and previously conducted research. <br><br>

                    It served as a baseline to identify any gaps in the product before undertaking any ideation effort.
